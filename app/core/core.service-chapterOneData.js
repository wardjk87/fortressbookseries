She yawns and snuggles with her pillow trying to go back to sleep and says, \u201cI'm so tired and sleepy.\u201d \n \u201cI know it's early, Star. Really, I'm sorry, but I've got to talk to you.\u201d By the tone of River's voice, she instantly knows something is up even in her half-asleep state. As she begins to rub her eyes, she asks, \u201c Well, what's wrong?\u201d Then it hits her. \u201cOh no! Oh no! You had another one of those dreams from the Lord, didn't you?  I knew it!\u201d \n \u201c Yes, I think it was a  dream, or I mean, I don't know if it was a dream or some kind of a vision from God.\u201d \n \u201c I just knew it! Okay, now I'm wide awake, River, and you have my undivided attention.\u201d \n Starlight starts pulling herself up from the old three-inch orange foam mattress covered with a clean but old hand-sewn quilted blanket made from big patches of soft, faded, and torn old blue denim Levi jeans. The mattress is resting on top of a one-half inch sheet of plywood on 1\u201dx 6\u201d pine slats and a wooden bed frame made from 2\u201dx4\u201ds. Underneath the half-inch plywood that supports the relatively thin mattress they sleep on is a large portion of their earthly possessions. Up above their heads are their Grizzly model Bear recurve bows that they love to shoot for target practice. The bows are unstrung and are resting on gray plastic gun racks screwed into the metal upright window frames of the van. Behind the driver's seat is River's black hard plastic guitar case that contains his expensive Fender acoustic guitar that he worked hard to save money for in the summer of his 15th birthday. River's grandfather had taken out all of the bench seats after the van was purchased, so he could live a nomadic, hippie lifestyle in the late 1960's. He had built the small bed in the back of the van to sleep on. River's guitar is held in place by two bungee cords tied to the VW van wall. It rests upon a small RV refrigerator at the foot of the bed that they use to keep their food and drinks cool on extended stays at campgrounds. Almost all of their other belongings are in small cardboard boxes and plastic crates. They are trying to live a minimalist's lifestyle, but the van has gotten increasingly smaller as the months have gone by since their marriage began."

It is needed for the cool Colorado nights in Boulder. After about 45 years of use, it is becoming frayed and has three small moth eaten holes near the middle of it. Night temperatures have been dipping down into the mid 50's lately. Starlight knows that major change is going to happen with this new revelation River has gotten from God and she is bracing herself for it. Now her legs are crisscrossed Indian style with her back next to the left padded back door of their vintage original 1967 VW van. Her mouth is a little dry, and she reaches backwards with her hand to grab her water bottle that she nightly wedges in between the corner of the bed frame and van. She takes a drink. The van has been their home on the road for about 18 months since they left Redwood, California where they grew up. They have spent a total of about nine nights in cheap motels since they got married, mostly when the temperature has gotten really cold. On their one-year anniversary, River splurged and got them a room in a Hampton Inn in Colorado Springs. Starlight thought she had died and gone to heaven. \nThe paint on the lower half of the outside of the vehicle is light blue and the upper part is white from the factory, or what little of it that is left untouched, because the van is mostly covered with multi-colored hand-painted flowers. River had inherited it from his grandfather, Jack Miller, who had raised him. He had died about a year before River and Starlight decided to leave the Utopian Experimental Community outside of Redwood, California, where they grew up and lived their entire lives. They left the day Starlight turned 18 and got married by a justice of the peace in a nearby town."

Two days before he died, his grandfather was very sick in bed, and he told River that he had made a lot of mistakes in his life. Jack admitted to River if he had to do it all over again he would have done a lot of  things differently. But River had told his grandfather that he loved him anyway and hugged him tightly. He told him that he was glad he was his grandfather and that he didn't want to lose him. A local preacher by the name of Larry Dunkin felt led by the Lord to visit his old teammate from high school, Jack Miller. He didn't know he had stage four cancer in a very advanced state. Jack had only been recently diagnosed with it about two weeks before. He had been sick for the last couple of months but had never gone to the doctor. He kept fooling himself it was just due to the fact that he was getting older. Larry and Jack  had played baseball together at Redwood High School for four years and had been good friends. Pastor Dunkin knocked on the front door and River answered it. Dunkin explained why he wanted to see his old friend. River was only vaguely familiar with Pastor Dunkin. He explained that his grandfather had not been feeling well but he would check with him. \n  River asked his grandfather if he wanted to see a pastor by the name of Larry Dunkin. His grandfather's tired eyes perked up and he said, \u201cI feel okay enough to see him. I haven't seen Dunk in a good while. Send him in.\u201d Jack Miller had resisted the simple message of salvation for years from his friend Larry. But, tonight his heart was soft and the fear of death loomed over him like a dark cloud. An hour later, after a lot of memories were exchanged and a lot of  laughter and tears were shed, Pastor Dunkin led Jack Andrew Miller to the Lord. Until his grandfather died two days later, River had never seen his grandfather with so much peace and joy on his face. It was something that played with his mind over and over and he couldn't shake it. Here his grandfather was dying and yet he seemed happy about it. River asked him about it and his grandfather reassured him that he loved him with all his heart. His grandfather told him he hated leaving him and wished he had more time to spend with him. The reason for his joy and peace was that Jesus Christ had forgiven him from a lifetime of sin and was so real to him. Fear of death and the unknown it brings had totally quit plaguing his mind.  Jack Miller had begged River to meet with his friend Dunkin and hear him out about the Lord. But, River was angry at God because his grandfather was so close to death and also because of his dad's accidental death. It would take months and a miracle for River to let go of his anger and resentment toward God."

River and his dad had had a great relationship. Because of the impact of his father's death, River swore to Starlight and his grandfather that he would never drink or get high. It was a promise he had always kept. He didn't make it his mission in life to condemn others that did drink or do drugs. It just wasn't for him. Jack  Miller also put away his use of alcohol and recreational pot habit as a result of his son's death and River's commitment. \n River's mom split the scene from the Utopian Experimental Community with a charismatic small time drug dealer from Seattle soon after River was born. She supposedly died from a drug overdose of prescription pills two months after leaving the community. Lisa Jenkins had been an army brat and had lived all over the world with her family. She had never liked the idea of being pinned down in one place too long because she got bored and liked change and adventure. She had met Canyon Moore at a local flea market in Redwood and had fallen instantly head over heels in love with him and he with her.  But, within less than a year she had fallen out of love with Canyon and would be gone forever. \n  Jack Miller was the leader of the original hippie members who helped form the commune in 1969 where River and Starlight had been raised. Most of the hippies of the 1960's were the catalysts for the radical cultural revolution of their era; but, in time, these individuals had returned to a more moderate version of their parents' traditional lifestyle long before the turn of the 21st century. The novelty and excitement of their rebellious, free lifestyle had eventually worn off. But, Jack Miller had held on to his 1967 flower covered hippie VW van regardless of the changes. His van was like a monument on wheels to a former way of life of almost complete freedom and carefree rebellion. It had helped him to ride the crest of the wave in his day. When he was younger, he had often referred to it as his chick magnet.  On the back of River's inherited genuine hippie van from California was a large painted white peace sign and below it in two  inch letters read, \u201c Give peace a chance\u201d. But, lately Starlight had told River she wanted to change it to a cross in the middle and paint in white letters, \u201cGive Jesus a chance.\u201d"

She says, \u201cOh, oh, River, I don't understand. I don't really understand why this stuff is happening to us. \u201d Tears are forming and falling from the corners of her deep blue eyes as she says, \u201c I thought things were going so good for us in here in Boulder. I thought for sure we were in the center of God's will. We finally got some decent money coming in with my cashier job at the New Mane Salon and from your private guitar and harmonica lessons. With our gigs singing in the coffee houses and clubs, we are finally getting our heads above water financially. I thought maybe we could finally settle down and get an apartment and quit living out of this tin can of a van or sleeping in a tent sometimes. But, now I'm scared silly, because the last two times this happened God spared our lives.\u201d \n \u201cYea, I know.  It's freakin' me out too, \u201dsays an anxious 20 year old River Jenkins. The angelic vision has shaken him to his core and he repeatedly runs both his hands over his long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail and held in place by a red rubber band. \n \u201cRiver, what exactly did God tell you in your dream-like state, or whatever you want to call it? \u201dasks an inquisitive Starlight. \n \u201cStar, this time a huge angel came to me and said his name was Michael and that he was an archangel. Here is the bulk of what he said. The stench of sin of an evil people has reached the nostrils of God and He is repulsed by it - that destruction is coming, but we are in the shadow of the Almighty. Michael told me that just as it rains on the just and the unjust, so will destruction  fall on the just and the unjust. He said you and I and our new friend Patrick have been ordained to be set apart for a special purpose. Michael said all those who make up the generation alive today and those still to come that know God's son, Jesus, intimately were born for such a time as this. God has marked some for martyrdom and others will be preserved for different roles and purposes. He said not to fear death for it is but an exit door to your ultimate eternal reward. The angel made it clear that the power of God will fall on all the true followers and truth seekers of Christ who love Him and His Holy Word the Bible in these end times. They will be part of the Remnant Church Movement that will sweep across this country and to the ends of the earth. He said we will see and need the miraculous in order to sustain ourselves and survive the flood of wickedness that will be released on our country soon because the time is short \u201d"

They stand guard over a special flock there and abroad that will be divinely protected in the times to come. Soon these two shepherds will walk in a greater anointing from God, his favor and in experiencing the miraculous. Michael said God wants us to follow them as they follow Him,  because God will display His mighty  power through them as a witness to all who oppose Him. Michael also said the devil's heart will burn with anger toward them, but they are clothed and protected with strong prayer continually. He said we have been called to music evangelism to reach the last generation that knows not God nor the things of God. A great anointing will be released to us for the work to which we have been called. And last of all, Michael said he and his angel hosts that he commands would continually watch over us and all those who have been selected from the foundation of the world to walk through the fires of the Tribulation to be purified chosen vessels. \u201d \n \u201cWow, that is a lot. How in the world did you remember all that? \u201d inquires a surprised Starlight. \n \u201cIt's like the Holy Spirit downloaded it into my long term memory, \u201d replies River confidently. \u201c I can't explain it other than it is embedded into my brain cells.\u201d \n \u201c With all this taking place, we must be near the start of the tribulation according to all that Michael told you, River. Maybe it’s going to start any day, huh? \u201d  replies Starlight, who is now full of anticipation and whose faith is beginning to rise.\n \u201c Michael never narrowed it down or pinpointed exactly when it would start, but it must be really soon,\u201d says River. \n \u201c Michael is like nine or maybe ten feet tall and wears a long white robe. He has blonde hair down to his shoulders and wears a  bright pure golden breast plate. He looks very powerful and intimidating physically. Believe me, he could snap the biggest, baddest, and strongest NFL player in half like a dried up twig if he wanted to, but I wasn't afraid of him.\u201d"

He is friendly and has what I would call a peaceful looking smile on his face. He said that he had been sent from God Almighty to tells us things that must quickly come to pass. Did he have a sword in his hand, like those angels in the book of Genesis guarding the Garden of Eden from Adam and Eve?\u201d asks Starlight.\n \u201c No, and believe me he looks like he doesn't need one either,\u201d replies River. \n Starlight starts thinking out loud to herself saying, \u201c I wonder if it is the same archangel Michael mentioned in the book of Daniel.\u201d \n \u201c Yeah, I bet he is the same one, Star. It hadn't occurred to me until now that he probably is the same angel. I have to call Patrick now\u201d declares River. \n Surprised, Starlight replies, \u201c Did the angel tell you to? \u201d \n \u201c No, I just know that I know that I need to,\u201d says River with total confidence. \u201c Again, I can't explain it.\u201d \n \u201c But is he going to believe you? \u201d asks Starlight as she surveys the surreal circumstances.\n \u201c Without a doubt in my mind, I know he will, \u201d replies River.\n But Starlight begins to reason in her own mind that maybe Patrick won't believe River. After all, she and  River have just met that guy. She knows he is a senior and a pre-med student at the University of Colorado. He is from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She doesn't know Patrick O'Malley very well and they are from two entirely different worlds. \n Nothing could be closer to the truth than what she has just spoken to River. All she knows about Patrick is that he has a northern accent, seems nice and friendly and came from a rich and  affluent family in Philadelphia. She also knows his dad is a well-known, prominent doctor on the east coast. She and River came from another time and place on the west coast, although they cannot escape the fact that they were raised on a genuine California hippie commune known as the Utopian Experimental Community - or UEC, like the members liked to call it. But River and Starlight have coined an identity for themselves. They like to think of themselves as \u201ccountry fried millennials\u201d in the 21st century."

There were days on the farm in which the winds didn't blow in the people's favor and certain conditions prevailed so that they couldn't escape the smell of fresh animal manure. Also there were two natural small ponds and a small man-made lake Jack had carved out with a bulldozer in the summer of 1971.. The ponds were well stocked with fish that Starlight and River loved to catch and usually released. Indeed the 21st century had brought changes to the commune, but old ways of the hippie culture still had some root. By the grace of God, neither River nor Starlight had embraced all the negative entanglements of that lifestyle. Both had known each other since they were babies, having grown up on the large communal farm. They had been best friends since they were kids. Everyone on the farm knew them and liked them, but they had just always marched to the beat of a different drum than the other  young people on the farm. \n  God had always put a special love in their hearts for each other. River had given Starlight a promise ring when she was 14 and he was 15. Even though both had not been raised in a traditional family or even a somewhat functional family, they both knew they wanted to have a traditional family life one day. Since the day River gave her the promise ring, Starlight had dreamed of one day walking down the aisle in a church. She had always imagined herself in an elegant white wedding dress holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers and marrying River, her knight in shining armor, but dressed in a black tuxedo. However, the complete dream had not come true as of yet. They had moved around a lot until they came to Boulder. \n  But even in Boulder they had not gotten  involved in a Bible believing church, let alone had enough money for a real traditional marriage ceremony. Of the seven churches they visited, they just couldn't find the right church to call home for one reason or another. The churches they visited were either way too liberal or too legalistic. Some services they attended at one big church reminded them of a little Las Vegas with all their entertainment productions to draw more people in. Others were cold and the members were impersonal or shallow. Some believed in the gifts of the spirit, but were walking in the flesh trying to manifest them. Some pastors emphasized the giving of money to the church and prosperity of the believers. Those ministers were always taking numerous offerings in the service. Most of the churches didn't emphasis the teaching of the word, prayer or discipleship, but had social programs as an outreach to the community. A lot of churches had two or three of these characteristics."

UEC was a large farm situated ten miles outside the city limits of Redwood. UEC members tried to be as independent as possible from outside interferences impacting their lifestyle, Most locals referred to the farm as the commune or hippie commune outside of town. UEC had been formed by a small number of people who had met at the historic Woodstock Music Festival in Woodstock, New York in 1969.  Jack Miller had been a good looking guy with a very charismatic personality and was a dreamer. He single handedly had influenced a group of about twenty people to return with him to Redwood and start building a utopian society. \n Most of the baby boomer generation who founded UEC eventually outgrew their constant diet of free love, drugs, and rock and roll and turned their energies to that of a more compromised capitalistic nature. Half of the original members had left. Still old ways had persisted among some old and newer wanna-be hippie members since UEC was founded in 1969. The community was known for its  high quality organic fruits, vegetables, eggs, and milk products. They also purchased and processed other small organic farms vegetables, fruits, grains, eggs and milk in the area that were of equally high quality and sold them under their Utopian Experimental Community label. All of the members of UEC and the other farms in their network were opposed to pesticides, herbicides, steroid usage in their farm animals and genetically modified seeds of any kind. Some UEC members were also known for another type of farming. Several members had  been busted over the years by law enforcement officials for clandestine marijuana crops grown on state land that bordered their property. There were always small crops for the needs of certain members of UEC. Pot was never grown as a cash crop to be sold to dealers or people outside the commune. \n Starlight was an energetic and spunky young woman with long, shiny blonde hair that was parted in the middle, hung down past her waist and was cut in a v pattern in the back. Her hair was the first thing people noticed about her. Her complexion was always slightly tanned because she loved being outdoors. She and River loved outdoors sports like hiking, rock climbing, bouldering, canoeing, kayaking, horseback riding and archery. She had always enjoyed helping her grandmother Jane and others on the farm do chores. She loved faded comfortable t-shirts and blue jeans and going barefooted as much as possible. A little dirt or manure between her toes never bothered her."

Starlight was down to earth, and even though she had a zest for life, she possessed a gentle spirit about her. People were just naturally drawn to her for different reasons. But a big reason they were attracted to her was because she possessed a rare special gift from God. It was her voice - and when she sang, people were mesmerized by it. She had an amazing natural opera sounding voice and had never taken any voice lessons in her life. Her voice had a tremendous range and could hit notes that seemed impossible that she could hold for an extended period of time. River was also a gifted guitar and harmonica player and he had a great voice too but it was Starlight who always took center stage. When River and she sang and played their rock folk music at coffee houses, clubs, music festivals and other venues, they usually brought the house down. Since they had both gotten saved about six months before in Colorado Springs, they found themselves gravitating more and more to Christian music. River and Starlight were continually reading and studying the Bible. \n Starlight had also started writing Christian songs. They had recently in the last few months started finishing their show with the song Amazing Grace. Most of their audiences were familiar with folk legend Joan Baez and her classic version of Amazing Grace. Starlight would mention that Joan Baez style of music and singing had had a tremendous influence on her style of singing and would say that she and River would like to close with their own rendition of Amazing Grace. River played the guitar while  Starlight sang. Often the unsaved masses in the places where they performed were reduced to tears by the conviction of the Holy Spirit touching their hearts when Starlight and River did their version of the song.  When they were done performing at the close of the show, they would tell everyone that they were Christians and if anyone needed prayer that they would be glad to pray for them. River would say they were not there to judge or beat anyone over the head with a Bible. Sometimes at least one or two or more would come forward and ask for prayer. Occasionally, Starlight and River would lead someone to Christ, which brought them great joy. Some people who were not interested in God  would wait until they were finished ministering to people and tell them how much they enjoyed the show, buy a CD, get an autograph, or find out more about their hippie upbringing, their van and/or their music."

She had to travel a lot and was gone much of the time. She tended to be a workaholic. Starlight cried herself to sleep many a night saying to herself that only River really cared about her and loved her. Starlight's grandmother, Jane Weaver, was originally from Chicago, Illinois and had decided to plunge herself deep into the countercultural movement of the 1960's. It was at Woodstock where she met Jack Miller and was captivated with his grand vision of building a utopian hippie community in Redwood, California. As one of eight original female founding members of the Utopian Experimental Community, she had risen to taken on a matriarchal role in the community. \n Jane Weaver had been a radical wild woman in the 60's and a heavy drug user. But, she had kicked a bad drug habit after she had gotten pregnant with Moonbeam. Since her daughter was born, she had always been a recreational user.

Organic farming had become her passion and she loved being involved in the day to day operations of the farm as a supervisor over the dairy herd and the quality of dairy  products UEC produced.

What Michael told you sounds like a riddle about two shepherds who live on the grounds of a fortress not built with stone and mortar. What does that mean?\u201d \n \u201cFirst let me say I didn't tell you this part yet, because you were already having a hard time.\u201d \n \u201cI know, I know!

I'm not God. Maybe he knows that people just would not believe us if we told them.

If you have sent the angel Michael to warn us to leave Boulder along with our friend Patrick, we have to submit to your will. There are people we like and care about in this city and we wish everyone would get saved. But, you are God and we have asked your Son Jesus to be our Lord and Savior, both Starlight and myself, as well as Patrick. So please help Starlight, Patrick, and me to bow our knees to your will being done in our lives. Please be with Starlight's friend Jenny and her boyfriend and convict them of their of sins and to say the sinner's prayer in the tract.  Please Lord. Amen.\u201c"

He said his name was Michael and that God had chosen me and others that I would join with for a special purpose. The angel said that you and Starlight have also been chosen along with a fourth individual who will join us in our first leg of the journey. Michael said we were to walk in faith and be bold and strong in the Lord. He said that in the coming days we will walk through the fires of the Tribulation, but will not be burned but purified.

I didn't know what. It didn't make any sense. I thought I was going nuts. I just pulled in here eight days ago from Philly and I had basically just unpacked all the things from my SUV into my one bedroom apartment. I was excited that the start of the new fall semester at U of C is just a few days away. But, last night I was compelled to pack my stuff. All my junk is by the front door of my apartment. If nothing happens and I'm not back in school real soon after it starts and I tell my parents about this, they are going to have me placed in a psychiatric hospital back in Philly. It was hard enough to talk them into letting me attend the University of Colorado to study medicine instead of the University of Pennsylvania, where my dad graduated. I have a lot at stake here. River, where did the angel tell you we need to go?\u201d \n \u201cHe, ah... he ah, it hasn't been revealed yet to me.\u201d \n \u201cWhat the heck?  You mean you don't know? Oh great!

Throw all your stuff in your SUV and meet us here at the Happy Camper Campground, lot 121. We are in an old 1967 VW van with flowers all over it. You can't miss us,\u201d says River.\n \u201cYeah, I know exactly where the campground is. It's right down the road less than a half a mile from Ci Mada Union Laboratories, that huge five story gray mirrored building that's mostly hidden right at the lower tree line of the mountain with huge natural boulders around it.\u201d \n River's mind is dazed for a second and he says, \u201cHey, repeat that.

Guys, I'm sensing that maybe you know something about Ci Mada that I don’t know. Is it something regarding genetic research of seeds, plants, and animals?\u201d \n \u201cOh definitely! Yes we do - especially me, Patrick,\u201d declares Starlight in an angry tone. \u201cNo wonder God is getting us out of here.\u201d With a voice of righteous anger, she then  goes on to say, \u201cPatrick, listen. Ci Mada has been messing around with mother nature and making gmo seeds and frankenstein foods and animals for years with nothing more than a slap on the wrist. Crooked politicians, departments of governments, and university research centers who are supposed to be looking out for the health of the American people have become rich, fat cats from catering to Ci Mada’s demands. So now I’m guessing there's probably an unknown major fault line below our very feet and God is going to drop judgment on that wicked company. He possibly might cause a  rift in the earth's crust  that  is going to appear and Hell is going to open its gates and swallow that company. Either that might happen or, who knows, one of those meteorites that have been hitting south of us and elsewhere is going to slam into it and blow it up. I don't know, but that is my spiritual gut feeling.  This is probably why the Lord wants us out of here, Patrick..\u201d \n  River speaks up with emphasis, \u201cStarlight knows all about that evil company and I'm kinda thinking she might be right, Pat, about what is coming.\u201d \n \u201cThat could be the case.

At this moment I'm beginning to remember some things people said about Ci Mada being kind of evil in a lot of ways\u201d.\n \u201cOh, definitely, Patrick,\u201d says Starlight. \u201cI distinctly remember on more than one occasion Moonbeam said Ci Mada Union had deep ties with the establishment. Their evil foreign-born director who runs that place, whose name I can't remember, was a real creep and she had heard rumors that his dad did genetic research for Hitler. She said Ci Mada was intentionally destroying mother nature and the health of the American people.\u201d \n \u201cStarlight, all I basically knew about Ci Mada before was that they did genetic research and that they paid good money to pre-med students from the university. Two former friends of mine who were unsaved and who were pre-med students like myself got jobs there making big bucks. They made eighteen dollars an hour at Ci Mada working part-time before school was out doing research. They were also told by their supervisors they could work the whole summer making tons of  overtime if they wanted to and possibly get pay raises and bonuses. They had to sign confidential agreements and go through extensive background checks to get the jobs. They told me it was a done deal for me to get a job with the company with me being an upperclassman in pre-med and my GPA being a lot higher than theirs. So I had an interview with a guy named Nash and when he saw I was a born again Christian on my application the interview was basically over at that point. He made up some bogus excuse that he had an important  meeting with some VIP's in the company, that he had forgotten about it, and that he would call me in about an hour and a half to continue the interview at another time. He never called me back, so I went on home to Philly this past summer and worked in my dad's medical office shuffling papers around and doing 'gofer' jobs at ten dollars an hour.\u201d \n \u201cPatrick, that sounds about right knowing what we know about Ci Mada. That company is continually tampering with our fragile food chain, God's creatures, nature in general, and is apparently opposed to the Bible and Christianity. Our families and friends have been committed to high standards in the organic food industry for 50 years and Ci Mada is totally opposed to that industry,\u201d says a livid Starlight."

I never believed in that fairy tale of a quick escape from the earth called the rapture.\u201d \n \u201cMaybe you haven't, Starlight, but a lot of Christians believe that doctrine as if it was the gospel,\u201d says Patrick with strong conviction.\n \u201cWell, all I have to say is a fan of our music felt led to give me an old copy of a book by a guy named James McKeever. After a gig at the Showtime Club in Colorado Springs, he came up and gave us a copy of McKeever's book entitled Christians Will go through the Tribulation. I read it as a brand new babe in Christ and it made a lot of sense to me,\u201d snaps Starlight.\n \u201cMe too,\u201d says River. \u201cPatrick, Starlight and I have spent most of our time just reading the Bible. When we read and study the Bible, we always pray for the Holy Spirit to reveal nothing but the truth of God's Word to us.\u201d \n \u201cAbsolutely! I'm not interested in the doctrines of men,\u201d adds Starlight in a resolute voice.\n \u201cI just want to say this one thing, Pat and Star, that is so key for us to remember.\u201d \n \u201cWhat, River?\u201d asks a curious Starlight.\n \u201cIt's this, that if God has gone to this much trouble to use an angel and these divine coincidences to clearly show us to go and see Gary Kirkman and Ricky Crawford, the authors of this book here, then I think we need to sit at their feet and listen to what they have to say,\u201d replies River.\n  \u201cAmen! That's a very true statement. And I want to add that I don't know exactly all the reasons why the Lord has hooked me up with you guys, but I know he has. There is no doubt now in my mind. I have regrets about leaving Boulder, but this whole ordeal is so much bigger than us here.\u201d"

I think we need them for the trip to Golden Valley.  Our cell phones won't work when we have to travel through some of the mountainous areas. I have a GPS screen in my SUV and I'll program it for Golden Valley. We'll be able to use it for some of the trip. I also have a current road atlas for a back up. Are you familiar with this kind  of walkie talkie, River?\u201d asks Patrick.\n  \u201cOh, yes.  We used them on the commune sometimes and this is basically the same kind that Star and I used.\u201d \n \u201cOne last thing before we leave… I have to tell you guys this before we go that this whole thing since last night has seemed surreal. I mean really, I have replayed last night over and over again in my mind at least 100 times.  And now I can't believe I'm actually going on a road trip at this time with school soon to start and I might not be coming back here.\u201d Somewhere between a thin line of faith and fear he says, \u201cI'm going for it. So I guess let's get on the road,\u201d announces a seemingly inspired Patrick.\n  \u201cWe know exactly how you feel, Pat,\u201d empathizes River.\n  \u201cGreat! You guys ready to leave?\u201d \n  \u201cYes, we are!\u201d River and Starlight loudly reply.\n   As Starlight and River climb into their van, she tells River, \u201cIf we hadn't gone through this before, I would say we are nuts. Just plain fruity and nutty.\u201d \n \u201cI agree, if it wasn't for the fact that we have gone through two similar circumstances before. Starlight, you know what?\u201d \n \u201cWhat, River?\u201d \n \u201cI love you, and we are going to trust God by faith to go before us so we can accomplish His will for our lives.\u201d \n \u201cAmen, River, I love you too. We are walking by faith in these last days. Hey, River, look! Patrick is taking off.\u201d \n \u201cDon't worry, Star, I'm going to stay right on his tail.\u201d \n \u201cIt's Golden Valley or Bust!\u201c proclaims Starlight, full of faith and ready for their new spiritual journey to begin."
